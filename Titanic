# Import the Titanic dataset
import pandas as pd
Location = "titanic3.xls"
df = pd.read_excel(Location)

# Observe the data
df.head()

# Remove passengers who didn't survive
df_survived= df[df["survived"] == 1]
df_died= df[df["survived"] == 0]

# Compare the average age of survivors to non-survivors
# Average age of survivors
df_survived['age'].mean()
# Average age of non-survivors
df_died['age'].mean()

# Compare the averae ticket price that survivors paid to non-survivors
# Average ticket price that survivors paid
df_survived['fare'].mean()

# Average ticket price that non-survivors paid
df_died['fare'].mean()

# The fare's price is a strong indicator of who may have survived. Age is not a strong indicator.
# Average age of a survivor's fare was 49.36 compared to the average for non-survivor's fare of 23.35
# This can be explained by the fact that wealthier passengers had easier access to lifeboats.
