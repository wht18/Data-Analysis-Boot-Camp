# The fare's price is an indicator of who may have survived. It has a positive correlation of 0.244  with survival.
# This can be explained by the fact that wealthier passengers had easier access to lifeboats.
# However, there were passengers who paid higher than this average who didn't survive and passengers who paid less and did survive.

# Age is another indicator of who may have survived. Average age of a survivor's fare was 49.36 compared to the average for non-survivor's fare of 23.35.
