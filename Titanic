# Import the Titanic dataset

# Remove passengers who didn't survive and create a dataframe for survivors and non-survivors
df_survived= df[df["survived"] == 1]
df_died= df[df["survived"] == 0]

# Compare the average age of survivors to non-survivors
# Average age of survivors
df_survived['age'].mean()
# Average age of non-survivors
df_died['age'].mean()

# Compare the averae ticket price that survivors paid to non-survivors
# Average ticket price that survivors paid
df_survived['fare'].mean()

# Average ticket price that non-survivors paid
df_died['fare'].mean()

# Max fare of non-survivor
df_died['fare'].max()

#Min fare of survivor
df_survived['fare'].min()


# The fare's price is a strong indicator of who may have survived.
# Average age of a survivor's fare was 49.36 compared to the average for non-survivor's fare of 23.35.
# This can be explained by the fact that wealthier passengers had easier access to lifeboats.
# However, there were passengers who paid higher than this average who didn't survive and passengers who paid less and did survive.
